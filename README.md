# disaster-management-codefundo-
OUR AIM: Our aim is to work on an idea that can act as a link between the disaster inflected people, service providers, health facilities and the outside world.
In disaster situation, unavailability of communication is a major issue. So our effort is to develop a new system to resolve this problem. Other than its core purpose, we also look forward to record the overall statistics of the disaster situation. 
An OVERVIEW OF WORKING OF IDEA : Inflicted people would be sending messages/media using an application that would be specifically designed for this purpose to a drone via hotspot/Wi-Fi technology. The drone after reaching at the site of base computer would share all the data received till that point with the base computer and then an application on the base computer would do rest of the work.
Our main focus is on the application of the base computer that would aid in filtering the messages into categories such as :
- Health Cases
- Requirements
- Survey data
- Sending and receiving messages between the inflicted people and their loving ones.

The base computer would also be capable of sending a common message to all the inflicted people. It would have a track of all internal processes to create a statistics for future development in the area of disaster management.
We will divide the program into three parts :
1. Mobile application to send and receive text and media to and from the drone. This data transfer would be done by the means of hotspot/Wi-Fi technology.
2. The drone would be equipped with a basic system that is able to send and receive data by means of hotspot/Wi-Fi technology.
3.The application for the base computer. This is the field of our main focus. This is the heart of our project that will do most of the work.
